Face Detector using Haar Cascade | Python, OpenCV

  Developed a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifier, leveraging the laptopâ€™s built-in webcam to detect human faces.

Implemented a pre-trained Haar feature-based cascade model to identify facial features with high accuracy in live video streams.

Optimized frame processing for smooth performance, enabling seamless detection under varying lighting conditions.

Demonstrated core computer vision concepts, including image processing, feature extraction, and real-time object detection.
